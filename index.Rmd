In this site we describe our work in the Mexican Electoral quick-count, 
we include the following:

1. **Background**. Description of 2 methodologies that have been used in the past: 1) ratio estimation, and 2) a Normal Bayesian model.

2. **Our first approach**. How we came up with the mixture model we used in the
2018 state elections.

3. **Our second approach**. Moving from governor to presidential election, 
from JAGS to Stan (`r emo::ji("heart")`), and from mixture model to Negative Binomial.


4. **Enhancements for 2021**. Review of past elections and better approaches.

5. **Appendix 1**: Creating a model for simulating arrival times.

6. **Appendix 2**: Using the bias correction approach with ratio estimation.
